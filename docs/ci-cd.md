## On CI/CD
- automating development process
- CI(continuous integration) 
	- integrate code change frequently in repo
	- problems can be detected early and ensures that the code works before committing to source control
- CD(continuous delivery)
	- process to build and deploy app frequently without downtime
	
### Pipelines
- Build Pipeline: compiling, testing, packaging
- Release Pipeline: shipping to production via CI/CD and release
- Deployment Pipeline: similar to release pipeline, can include automated testing and monitoring

### Why CI/CD
- faster feedback loop and deployment
- reduced manual effort

### Flow
